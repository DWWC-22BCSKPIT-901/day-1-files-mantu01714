# DAY-1


## 1. **Sum of Odd Numbers up to N**
### Objective
Calculate the sum of all odd numbers up to a given positive integer `N`.

### Task
Write a program that takes an integer `N` as input and computes the sum of all odd numbers from 1 to `N`.

---

## 2. **Count Digits in a Number**
### Objective
Determine the total number of digits in a given positive integer `N`.

### Example
- Input: `12345` → Output: `5`
- Input: `900000` → Output: `6`

### Task
Write a program that:
1. Accepts a positive integer `N`.
2. Outputs the number of digits in `N`.

---

## 3. **Function Overloading for Calculating Area**
### Objective
Calculate the area of different shapes using function overloading.

### Task
Implement overloaded functions to compute the area of:
1. A circle (Input: Radius).
2. A rectangle (Input: Length and Breadth).
3. A triangle (Input: Base and Height).

---

## 4. **Implementing Polymorphism for Shape Hierarchies**
### Objective
Demonstrate runtime polymorphism using a base class `Shape` and derived classes `Circle`, `Rectangle`, and `Triangle`.

### Task
1. Use virtual functions to calculate and print the area of each shape.
2. Accept inputs as follows:
   - Radius of the circle for the `Circle` class.
   - Length and breadth of the rectangle for the `Rectangle` class.
   - Base and height of the triangle for the `Triangle` class.

---

## 5. **Hierarchical Inheritance for Employee Management System**
### Objective
Simulate an Employee Management System using hierarchical inheritance.

### Task
1. Design a base class `Employee` to store basic details (Name, ID, and Salary).
2. Create two derived classes:
   - `Manager`: Includes functionality to add and calculate bonuses based on performance ratings.
   - `Developer`: Includes functionality to add and calculate overtime compensation based on extra hours worked.
3. Allow input for both types of employees and display their total earnings.
